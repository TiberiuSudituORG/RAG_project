VPN Reset Procedure:
To reset VPN access, open the VPN application.
Click on the Reset button.
Wait 2 minutes and reconnect.

VPN Installation:
Download the VPN client from the internal portal.
Install and login using your employee credentials.

VPN Troubleshooting Guide:
If the VPN connection fails, first verify your internet connectivity by accessing an external website. 
Ensure that no other VPN or proxy service is running simultaneously, as this may cause conflicts. 
Restart the VPN client and try reconnecting. 
If the issue persists, reboot your workstation and attempt the connection again.
In case of authentication errors, confirm that your corporate password has not expired. 
Password expiration can prevent successful VPN login. 
If needed, reset your password using the internal identity management portal before retrying the VPN connection.

VPN Security Requirements:
All employees must comply with company security policies when using the VPN. 
Personal devices are not permitted unless explicitly approved. 
The operating system must be updated with the latest security patches, and antivirus software must be active and up to date. 
Connections from public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks are discouraged unless absolutely necessary.

Access Requests and Support:
If VPN access is blocked or unavailable, submit a ticket to the IT Service Desk. 
Include your employee ID, department, device type, and a brief description of the issue. 
Requests are typically processed within one business day. 
Emergency access requests outside working hours must be approved by a direct manager.

Session Timeout Policy:
VPN sessions automatically disconnect after 8 hours of inactivity. 
Users are required to reconnect manually. 
This policy is enforced to reduce security risks and free system resources.
